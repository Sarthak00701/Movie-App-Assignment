## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `Side Note`

* I wasn't able upload the node modules folder as it was too big for github. We can get get it easily using the
```sh
$ yarn create react-app movie-app --template redux-typescript
``` 
command.

* The search bar is not working properly because I have used ComponentDidUpdate and not ComponentDidMount.
